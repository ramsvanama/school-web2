          The food options and responsibilities to consider,
          canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past.
          Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared,
          and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional
          choices.
          Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account
          on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may
          have.
          Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling,
          making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike.
          Here again,
          diversity is the key.

        <h4>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h4>
        <img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
        <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">
          Implemented Online Attendance Management System: This informs parents about their
          child's/children's activities in the school, instantly. Once a student reaches the school,
          the parents will be informed about the status via text messages. This helps schools keep a record of the
          student's
          absenteeism. Students can mark the attendance by logging in, and this is stored in a database, which can later
          be checked
          by the Admin. The tracker has so much potential that it can identify which students are irregular to their
          classes and not
          ready to establish connectivity with the actual concepts of their curriculum’s subjects. As soon as you enter
          a student’s
          Enrollment Number or Name, details like availability in classes, number of lectures attended will be displayed
          and no proxies
          are possible since the tracker is supported by cloud capabilities. Even the security offered can be so robust
          and powerful
          that those students who always fool their deans are caught in a shorter span – just after the admin enters
          login details
          into this tracker. All this will improve accuracy and transparency in any of the educational institutions as
          students and
          their parents are pre-informed about the real-time status of leave requests
          and absenteeism in a confidential manner and at reduced costs.
